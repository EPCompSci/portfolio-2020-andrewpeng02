# iOS-Portfolio
I'm Andrew Peng, and this is my portfolio of all the apps I created as part of my high school iOS App Development class (Fall 2020). I learned about how to create a basic user interface with animations, as well as creating games using Apple's SpriteKit framework. This was mainly a self-taught class, and I learned through online resources such as Apple tutorials or developer blogs/tutorials.

# iOS Apps
## [Stratagem](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios/Stratagem)
A work in progress game built with SwiftUI, collaberating with Niraj Amin, Martin Zhou, and Jacob Peterson. This game can best be described as a real-time-stratagy game that's easy to learn and fun with friends.

## [Task Manager](https://github.com/andrewpeng02/task-manager-swiftUI/)
A basic task manager that supports adding, deleting, and finishing tasks with deadlines. I learned about basic animations and SwiftUI views in this project.
